# mockup-comments

## Header:
:seven:/:two::three:
- [ ] Noticed that you added "/", but not sure that it makes sense :)
- [x] Added space between the header titles and the thin line in the header
- [x] Noticed that you kept the thin line, which now it makes sense to have it to separate with bread crumbs. (keep)

:seven:/:two::four:
- [x] Can we remove the "/"?

## Footer:
:seven:/:two::three:
- [x] It looks to me a little busy there.. i suggest that we remove the social media icons as they don’t apply directly to “developer portal” anyway.

:seven:/:two::four:
- [ ] Can we work on the spacing of the items? Why is the font size of privacy and t&c so much smaller?

## Home:
:seven:/:two::three:
- [ ] I am still working on creating the content for it...

## APIs:
:seven:/:two::three:
- [x] looks good, only in bread crumbs, API or APIs?

## Tracker page:
:seven:/:two::three:
- [ ] in bread crumbs, API or APIs?
- [ ] missing “news/latest updates” section
- [ ] but i like “create an account and get started” at the bottom of the page
- [ ] need more discussion..

## Documentation:
:seven:/:two::three:
- [ ] search within documentation page, do we need another search?
- [ ] Messaging overview will not have "Download OpenAPI specification" link as it will be in each individual API documentation page

## Support:
:seven:/:two::three:
- [ ] looks good!

## About:
:seven:/:two::three:
- [ ] I am still working on creating the content for it...

## Sign In:
:seven:/:two::three:
- [ ] looks good

## Create account:
:seven:/:two::three:
- [ ] Can we move "Are you a swift.com user?"" to the top of the box right below "Create account"?

## My Apps:
:seven:/:two::three:
- [ ] "Sandbox", "Live" status icon looks good to me

## Create new App:
:seven:/:two::three:
- [ ] "Redirect URIs" looks good to me

## GPI test app:
:seven:/:two::three:
- [ ] Ready to go live? (i like this), but instead of "Register your app at swift.com", it's better to say "Contact your account manager" (need to think on that)
- [ ] Can you also provide the look and feel when the app is in "Live" status?

## Color:
:seven:/:two::three:
- [ ] If you have time, could you update the color where it’s “burn orange” now to “Rose pink (#970254)” and “Tarragon Green (#B5A300)?
