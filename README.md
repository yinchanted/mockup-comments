# mockup-comments

## Header:
	Noticed that you added “/“, but not sure that it makes sense :)
	Noticed that you kept the thin line, which now it makes sense to have it to separate with bread crumbs. (keep)
	 
## Footer: 
	It looks to me a little busy there.. i suggest that we remove the social media icons as they don’t apply directly to “developer portal” anyway.

## Home:
	I am still working on creating the content for it...

## APIs:
	looks good, only in bread crumbs, API or APIs?

## Tracker page:
	in bread crumbs, API or APIs?
	missing “news/latest updates” section
	but i like “create an account and get started” at the bottom of the page
	need more discussion..

## Documentation: 
	search within documentation page, do we need another search?
	Messaging overview will not have “Download OpenAPI specification” link as it will be in each individual API documentation page

## Support:
	looks good!

## About: 
	I am still working on creating the content for it...

## Sign In: 
	looks good

## Create account:
	Can we move “Are you a swift.com user?” to the top of the box right below “Create account”?

## My Apps:
	“Sandbox”, “Live” status icon looks good to me

## Create new App:
	“Redirect URIs” looks good to me

## GPI test app:
	Ready to go live? (i like this), but instead of “Register your app at swift.com”, it’s better to say “Contact your account manager” (need to think on that)
        Can you also provide the look and feel when the app is in “Live” status?

## Color:
	If you have time, could you update the color where it’s “burn orange” now to “Rose pink (#970254)” and “Tarragon Green (#B5A300)?
