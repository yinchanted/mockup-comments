# mockup-comments

## Header:
:seven:/:two::three:
- [x] Noticed that you added "/", but not sure that it makes sense :)
- [x] Added space between the header titles and the thin line in the header
- [x] Noticed that you kept the thin line, which now it makes sense to have it to separate with bread crumbs. (keep)

:seven:/:two::four:
- [x] Can we remove the "/"?
- [x] Can we change the font for "Developers" to "Courier New" in bold? to give a bit dev feel.

## Footer:
:seven:/:two::three:
- [x] It looks to me a little busy there.. i suggest that we remove the social media icons as they don’t apply directly to “developer portal” anyway.

:seven:/:two::four:
- [x] Can we work on the spacing of the items? Why is the font size of privacy and t&c so much smaller?

:seven:/:two::five:
- [x] like the spacing and visually separate the contents!

## Home:
:seven:/:two::three:
- [ ] I am still working on creating the content for it...

## APIs:
:seven:/:two::three:
- [x] looks good, only in bread crumbs, API or APIs?

## Tracker page:
:seven:/:two::three:
- [x] in bread crumbs, API or APIs?
- [x] missing “news/latest updates” section
- [x] but i like “create an account and get started” at the bottom of the page
- [x] need more discussion..

:seven:/:two::four:
- [x] recommend a different style for "news/latest updates" section, see elasticsearch [breaking changes](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/libbeat/7.2/breaking-changes.html) and [release note](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/libbeat/7.2/release-notes-7.2.1.html)

:seven:/:two::five:
- [x] like the style for "Latest updates". Are you planning to add more content to this section? If not, can we make the box shorter?

:octocat: "Add to my app", let's leave the button there for now but only if the user is logged in.

:seven:/:two::six:
- [ ] is there a way to make "View Documentation" closer to the content? It appears to be on the side and can be missed..

## Documentation:
:seven:/:two::three:
- [x] search within documentation page, do we need another search?
- [x] Messaging overview will not have "Download OpenAPI specification" link as it will be in each individual API documentation page

:seven:/:two::five:
- [x] left panel navigation sections look good
- [x] Can we add vertical scroll bar for left panel navigation

:octocat: the ideal is to make documentation 1 single page (for the right section). Left panel navigation would be sectioned and have a vertical scroll bar. I don't quiet understand your question here.. let's talk about this over the call?

:seven:/:two::six:
- [x] looks good for the Tracker API v3 Overview + Change Log page, where it's not one single page from top to bottom. I don't think we have to make it one page, what's the real benefit of doing that actually?

## Support:
:seven:/:two::three:
- [x] looks good!

## About:
:seven:/:two::three:
- [ ] I am still working on creating the content for it...

## Sign In:
:seven:/:two::three:
- [x] looks good
- [x] can we remove links in the header?

:seven:/:two::four:
- [x] i think it looks cleaner to leave out "Get quick access to your..."
- [x] can you create wireframe for "forget my password" page?

## Forgot password:
:seven:/:two::five:
- [x] looks good for success which redirects to Sign in page, and error when email not found

## Create account:
:seven:/:two::three:
- [x] Can we move "Are you a swift.com user?"" to the top of the box right below "Create account"?

:seven:/:two::four:
- [x] looks good

:seven:/:two::five:
- [x] i like the field check for "gmail" etc, can we also check for "swift.com"? and prompt them to directly sign in?

## My Apps:
:seven:/:two::three:
- [x] "Sandbox", "Live" status icon looks good to me

## Create new App:
:seven:/:two::three:
- [x] "Redirect URIs" looks good to me

:seven:/:two::four:
- [x] Can you provide the look and feel for when one URI is added?

:seven:/:two::five:

:octocat: multiple URI looking good!

## GPI test app:
:seven:/:two::three:
- [x] Ready to go live? (i like this), but instead of "Register your app at swift.com", it's better to say "Contact your account manager" (need to think on that)
- [x] Can you also provide the look and feel when the app is in "Live" status?

:seven:/:two::five:
- [x] Can you provide multiple URIs in the app info section?

## Color:
:seven:/:two::three:
- [x] If you have time, could you update the color where it's "burn orange" now to "Rose pink (#970254)" and "Tarragon Green (#B5A300)"?

:seven:/:two::four:
- [x] Can you put these swap the "burn orange" with these two colors for the "Support" page and "GPI test app" page?

## Getting started guides:
:seven:/:two::four:
- [x] Can you provide the look and feel of a simple page for [this page](https://developer.swift.com/getting-started-pre-validation-platform-sdk-pilot)?

:seven:/:two::five:

:octocat: looks good to me in term of the layout of the page. The content on this "getting started guide" will slip between "Sandbox" section (where we explain the URL and how to get access to sandbox) and "Overview" section (where postman collection goes here) on the documentation page. This is more of a note for myself, I don't see any additional design work needed here.

:seven:/:two::six:
- [x] like the sandbox section including the sandbox URL and getting started section. let's keep it in that structure.

## Release notes:
:seven:/:two::five:
- [x] Let's first rename "Release versioning" or "Release notes" to "New features and bug fixes" since the content will go on each version of the API.

:boom::boom: It makes me wonder how can we make all the information in one page but having a  "version" dropdown on the tracker documentation page?

:seven:/:two::six:
- [x] change log section looks very good inside each API reference overview section

## Logo:
:seven:/:two::five:
- [x] still in evaluation :)

## Tracker V3 reference:
:seven:/:two::six:
- [ ] I want to propose some small changes, let's talk on the call, much easier that way :)
